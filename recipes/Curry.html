    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>Onion and garlic</li>
      <li>Tomato products</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>Spices and seasonings</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>

    </ul>
    <p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt. Heat oil in a large
        skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil in
        batches until completely browned on all sides. Transfer browned chicken
        breasts to a plate and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        MReduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil
        remaining in the skillet. Cook and stir until onion turns soft and
        translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, turmeric,
        coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture;
        allow to heat together for about 1 minute while stirring.
      </li>
      <li>
        LAdd tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon
        salt to the mixture; stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate.
        Pour in 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat
        with the sauce. Sprinkle garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the
        chicken. .
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in
        the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F
        (74 degrees C). Drizzle with lemon juice to serve.
